# FAQ

## How much will PennApps cost me?

Not only will we provide you with a weekend's worth of swag, meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when you need a break from coding, we'll even help cover your travel. This cycle we're excited to have even more travel reimbursements available than past years!

## Once I am accepted, what do I need to bring?

_Need:_ Laptop and charger, cellphone and charger, sleeping bag, pillow, toiletries, a couple changes of clothes (nerdy shirts are particularly appreciated). Consider bringing clothes that can get wet (I can neither confirm nor deny there may or may not be a water fight).

_Don't need:_ a pre-determined team, an idea for an app, food or drink.

_Please don't bring:_ Firearms or other weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, soldering or similar equipment, animals (no matter how adorable).

## How do reimbursements work?

When you're accepted, we'll have a page where you can submit your required travel reimbursement forms and receipts. For each location hackers will be coming from, we’ll determine a reasonable cap. We will reimburse travel costs up to this cap—if you go over, we'll still reimburse the amount of the cap, but no more.

## When/where can I hack?

PennApps will start with the kick-off ceremony at Penn Engineering Quad. There will be events planned throughout the day for those who arrive early. A detailed schedule of events and locations will be posted later. All work eligible for prizes must be completed between Friday night after the kick-off and Sunday morning.

## What can I win?

It's not about winning — it's about learning and making friends that last for a lifetime (so everyone's a winner!). If you're thinking, "that's adorable... but really," then we've got you covered too. A panel of professional judges will select the top three hacks based on the following criteria: creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness. Top prizes are TBA, but usually involve thousands of dollars and insane perks from company sponsors. Most sponsors offer their own prizes too for specific categories, which they judge and fund themselves. We had well over $40k worth of prizes up for grabs last time including Nintendo Switches and Oculus Rifts, if you like numbers.

## I'm interested in using hardware for my hack!

You're in luck! We have a whole team of organizers devoted to hardware. Check out the hardware section to see what they have planned.

## What's the application process like?

We're looking for creative and innovative people with a set of skills that can contribute to a project - mobile, web, hardware, design, or anything else really cool. We generally prefer people that have proven their abilities in previous projects, evident through links, project descriptions, Github profiles, video demos or participation/awards in other hackathons. We don't require that you've participated in a hackathon ever before, but show us what makes you special in whatever way is most natural.

## When will applications close?

The application will close July 15th at 11:59pm EDT.

## Who can apply?

Any college, university, or high school student 15 years or older on September 1st, 2019 is eligible to apply.

## Should Penn students fill out the application too?

Nope! We'll have a separate registration process for Penn students only later in the summer. Every Penn student who wants to participate is free to, as long as they register in advance. No application process.

## I'm not a student, so how can I get involved?

Unfortunately, we can't allow you to participate in the event or be on site during hacking. If you're looking to mentor (i.e. someone with technical skills who'd be willing to help out participants during the weekend), you should reach out to us at hackerxp@pennapps.com. Otherwise, you can see the finished products at the demos on Sunday (time and location TBA).

## How is PennApps run?

PennApps is planned almost entirely by (sleep-deprived) University of Pennsylvania students, with some advice and assistance from our friends at Penn Engineering. One hundred percent of the funding for PennApps comes from corporate sponsor donations. You can find more information about sponsoring at our sponsor section.

## How should I behave?

Be respectful and considerate of your fellow hackers. We're all here to learn and have a good time. Everyone deserves the chance to hack free of the fear of being harrased.

## What should I do if I have additional questions or want to express my limitless gratitude?

Aw shucks. First check out **[this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Hjom5ZjHyzcFwHYFqVHLFV_sdFr7ki_aYCy4Z52KWU)** for more FAQs that will be updated in real time and if you really must thank us shoot us an email at **contact@pennapps.com**.
